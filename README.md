# Data Structures

This is a repository containing my implementations of various data structures in
a number of idfferent languages.

## Trees

Trees are a very common data structure in programming, useful for modeling many
things.

### Binary Trees

One of the most common forms of trees is the binary search tree. When balanced,
it is useful because of its guaranteed O(log n) search time. There are many
different implementations of such trees.
